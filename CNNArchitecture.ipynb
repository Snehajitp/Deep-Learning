Smaller filters require fewer parameters and are more efficient.\n",

        "The CNN architecture consists of:\n",
        "\n",
        "* A pre-trained convolutional base\n",
        "* Global Average Pooling layer\n",
        "* Fully connected dense layers\n",
        "* Dropout layer to prevent overfitting\n",
        "* Final output layer with a **sigmoid activation function** for binary classification\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **3. Model Training**\n",
        "\n",
        "The model is compiled using:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Binary Cross-Entropy** loss function\n",
        "* **Adam optimizer**\n",
        "* **Accuracy** as the evaluation metric\n",
        "\n",
        "Training is performed on the training dataset while monitoring performance on the validation dataset. Techniques such as **early stopping** and **model checkpointing** are used to save the best performing model and avoid overfitting.\n",

        "* Accuracy\n",
        "* Precision\n",
        "* Recall\n",
        "* Confusion Matrix\n",
        "\n",
        "In medical diagnosis tasks, **recall is particularly important** to minimize false negatives, ensuring pneumonia cases are not missed.\n",

        "## **5. Model Saving**\n",
        "\n",
        "After successful training and evaluation, the model is saved in `.h5` format so it can be reused during deployment without retraining.\n",

        "## **6. Deployment Using Streamlit**\n",
        "\n",
        "The trained CNN model is deployed as a **web application using Streamlit**, which provides a simple and interactive user interface.\n",

        "The Streamlit app allows users to:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Upload a chest X-ray image\n",
        "* View the uploaded image\n",
        "* Automatically preprocess the image\n",
        "* Get real-time predictions (Normal or Pneumonia)\n",
        "* Display prediction confidence scores\n",
        "\n",
        "A medical disclaimer is added to clarify that the system is intended for **educational and clinical assistance purposes only**, not for final medical diagnosis.\n",

        "## **7. Final Outcome**\n",
        "\n",
        "The deployed application successfully performs real-time classification of chest X-ray images and provides an easy-to-use interface for users. This end-to-end solution demonstrates the practical application of **deep learning in medical imaging**, combining model development with real-world deployment.\n",
